Guten Tag!

Ich heisse Michael... and I am fairly new to programming in general. As of this message, I have been learning Python for about a year and a half, most of that focused on data science. I was a History major at the University of California at Santa Barbara, but through my work experience, I have gained a deep appreciation and satisfaction from working with data. I'm hoping to work someday soon as a data scientist, so here it goes!
